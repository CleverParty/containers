# Checkpoints :

1) (major) golang and python containers work in unison.
2) (major) Docker images are able to host website in 2 clicks.

Pro-Tip :-
(A) When using Django App on localhost , the folowing  commands make life easier :
 -  "ps -ef | grep runserver" and also  "pkill -9 -f runserver" to kill the runserver on the chosen port.
