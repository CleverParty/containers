# containers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CleverParty/containers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CleverParty/containers)

# Checkpoints :

1) (major) golang and python containers work in unison.
2) (major) Docker images are able to host website in 2 clicks.
3) Isolated GET ping issues in golang-gin routers.

Proposed : A Full fledged dockerised communication platform

Pro-Tip :-
(A) When using Django App on localhost , the folowing  commands make life easier :
 -  "ps -ef | grep runserver" and also  "pkill -9 -f runserver" to kill the runserver on the chosen port.
(B) When using the conda enviroment , on macOS its easier to load into the base python env(base) by using : "source ~/.zshrc" after setting the bash-profile by adding "source ~/.bash_profile" to the ~/.zshrc file.
 - When in the base env, you can change the env by loading the required env through the source command,  and it will work like a charm.
